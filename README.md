# The data
The Ecopath data were obtain from @Jacquet2016NoCom on request to the corresponding author. Before manipulation, the data initially represented 116 Ecopath trophic networks. Ecopath is a modeling software which aims to quantify species interactions statically and is mass-balanced [@ChristensenEcoEco]. One weakness, if I may, is that a lot of these Ecopath networks are not taxonomically resolved to the species but encompass trophic groups or guilds. The first step here was then, for each of these networks, match the data to the original article from which they originated. This matching was done to
